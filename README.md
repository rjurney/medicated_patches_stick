# Make Medicated Adhesive Patches Stick. Period.

This post outlines a foolproof method [given to me by a hospice nurse but useful to me for chronic pain] for ensuring that medicated patches stick to… people like me to whom they will not stick :) I will try to avoid the use of the words ‘hairy’, ‘scaly’, ‘sweaty’ or ‘oily’ for the rest of this post, but as the instructional images may show… these things can be a factor. My own experience is with the Butrans patch for chronic pain, so the images in this post show a larger patch.

## Medical Disclaimer and Frank Warning

In this post there is helpful advice from what seems like a nice man, a list of easy-to-order, linked supplies, step-wise photographs [he must have spent some time on] and even helpful diagrams. Do not mistake this for medical advice. This post is not medical advice. Stated frankly: according to the manufacturer of the fentanyl patch, the method outlined wherein [while it attempts to mitigate the problem] may cause an increase in the amount of medication delivered which could induce opioid overdose.

What am I doing writing it then? Hospice. I’ve been a caretaker in a difficult situation: we could not control his pain as the fentanyl patch would not stick. Your mileage may vary. Ask your doctor or hospice nurse before attempting this method.

## Wha? Why won’t a patch stick to you?

Despite being licensed under expensive patents, medicated patch mechanisms aren’t effective for everyone. Reasons a patch may not stick to you include:

* You are hairy and it rapidly grows under the patch
* You are oily and it overcomes the adhesive
* You sweat a lot in a hot climate and the patch slides off
* You zone out in the shower and the hot water knocks it off
* Whatever the reason, it brought you here :)

## Supplies List

To the storehouse! You will need the following supplies. I don’t profit from the links [really], I just buy these products.

* A box of Large Prep Pads like the ones from Winner (available on Amazon).

<br />
* A 4" roll of 3M Tegaderm Dressing Transparent Film Roll breathable cover designed specifically for this application. It lets “stuff” in and out but prevents the patch from falling off. I need the large roll because my Butrans patch is large. For a smaller patch, there are smaller Tegaderm patch covers available at the drugstore. Note that large covers and rolls are quite expensive at the CVS so search for a deal online.

<br />*Different sizes of Butrans patch corresponding to dose*

<br />*4" roll of 3M Tegaderm Dressing Transparent Film Roll*

* Scissors. They don’t need to be medical, but the medical ones do work WELL :) Cost a couple of dollars. I put one in each bathroom drawer.
* A mini-blowdryer ($14.99 on Amazon) for a minute or two each patch. This is to heat and evaporate the alcohol from alcohol prep pads I use to thoroughly clean and strip the skin of oil. A full size can be used… if you can easily point it at the part on you to dry. The short barrel of a mini dryer is ideal.
* Optional: Uni Solve — 402300 Adhesive Remover Wipes can be used to clean the skin after patches are removed. Soap through a week of showering is enough for me, but if bathing that often isn’t possible Uni-Solve may help keep adhesive from building up on the skin.

<br />*Uni-Solve patches can remove adhesive buildup from wearing patches regularly.*

## Preparing the Patch Application Site

* Trim any hair where you will apply the patch. No diagram. Use your imagination. I shave, but you’re only supposed to trim.
* Thoroughly soap the area where the patch will be applied.

If your patch is changed weekly and you alternate sites, you will need to scrub one site during the off week to clean off the adhesive from last week’s patch. If that bothers you, adhesive removal.

<br />*A poor, hairy, soapy, [somewhat] disabled arm :(*

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71b9db0d-fc3a-4527-89cc-294699edcb4d" />
<br />*You do use soap, don’t you? Thoroughly dry the area with a dry towel when you are done.*

* I use one of the large alcohol prep pads to scrub the patch application area. Fold the wipe over and spread across fingers. Pinch in fingers at either end and scrub. Turn over and repeat.

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d085ee57-f86a-4ed1-accc-30b7eb6944bc" />
<br />*A single Winner Large Alcohol Prep Pad. And a bathtub.*

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2416a27-1010-406b-a624-9facc64cd186" />
<br />*You can see the dirt it is taking off on the pad. Use both sides.*

At this point in the instructions, I’ve got a problem. I have put alcohol on my skin and that can dissolve the adhesive matrix where the drug is contained, releasing extra in my system. Shaving the skin bare didn’t help the situation. Here comes our blow-dryer to make it all OK :) Mostly.

* I use my mini blowdryer [I love the linked blowdryer. I don’t own it, but I mean the look of it! And the price! Why didn’t I setup commercial links for this blockbuster hospice post?] for a minute or two to heat the area on low. If you’re a chronic pain patient or a masochist, your high pain threshold may result in the image below where the blowdryer is on high and your arm gets nice and… toasty.

<br />*Blowdrying the patch application site to remove any remaining alcohol from the alcohol prep pad scrub I gave it*

* I wait a few minutes for the skin to cool before I apply the patch because hot skin can make the patch dump extra medication.

## Optional: Adhesive Remover

If your patch is weekly, you should rotate sites back and forth from left to right. Usually, one spot on the body works best. Scrubbing the spot from last week’s patch (left this week, right last week) during the week the skin is uncovered should be enough to keep the skin clean.

For some people, some adhesive may still build up as weeks pass. Not everyone can bathe regularly enough to scrub off old adhesive. Adhesive from old patches can build up, are gross on the sticky skin and might prevent absorption of the medication in a new patch. Uni-Solve patches are a little harsh on the skin but take excess adhesive right off. Simply remove the patch and wipe it with a Uni-Solve wipe or two before removing it with soap and water.

## Applying the Patch

Applying the patch is just like the instructions on the box. Take off the big part of the backing, stick it on, peel the little backing off and make it stick too. Press the whole patch with your flat hand and also run your pointed fingers along all areas of the patch. Be good, and thorough.

<br />*Begin to stick the patch, using the unremoved backing as a grip*

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aff85c4-c9f4-484b-8233-91c5de7f0572" />
<br />*Remove the small backing and stick that too*

<br />*Mushing the patch with a flat hand*

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74ae5012-2d3f-4c02-88c5-b18c233de385" />
<br />*Use pointed fingers to press hard and seal the adhesive in place*

## Covering the Patch

The above still wasn’t enough for me. I was losing patches, they would start to fold, so I added a 3M Tegaderm cover to the recipe.

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0e2953a-438b-4456-a49f-79c55715f786" />
<br />*Grip the 3M Tegaderm roll firmly.*

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a6fef2d-f23f-4add-be67-8c97715fedee" />
<br />*Cut a portion of the roll off into a sheet sized about 1" larger on all sides than the diameter of your patch. It always takes more than you realize, so portion liberally.*

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2040a958-5692-4c9b-8c89-620d2a00e5c9" />
<br />*Cut off the corners to avoid any rolling up. Yes, this happened to me. A single angled cut across is fine.*

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/195a5c29-dad4-4b00-8eaf-e49cc98c6a43" />
<br />*The cut-out patch sheet [note the fancy round cuts that ignore the backing plate] should look something like this.*

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81effcc1-118a-4a2f-8aaf-15c1acf9fd47" />
<br />*I peel the correct backing off of the cover. You may waste one figuring it out. Repeat the flat / pointed-and-firm pressing procedure from the actual patch.*

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e17b0431-60e8-4308-a764-d175d6df2192" />
<br />*The completed work will look like this. The robot’s stance should appear happy, but not uppity. Damned robots.*

## Conclusion

I’ve used this method for applying the Butrans patch for a decade and my patches are highly resilient to everything including brief submersion in a hot tub [a no-no], or prolonged exposure to a shower head if I am face-planted into the wall with hot water on my poor neck :) They have never come off.

I’ve been meaning to write it for five long years. I hope this post can help someone deal with serious chronic pain or in the process of dying. I learned this method from a hospice nurse and it is my hope someone will experience less pain in their last days because of these instructions… but do ask your doctor or hospice nurse before you try it.
